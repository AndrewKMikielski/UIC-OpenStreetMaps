This is a project for my Data Structures course at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC).

The main features of this project were to

    - Write and test a Graph data structure (graph.h)

    - Locate and use a header-only JSON parser to parse OpenStreetMap (OSM) data that has been converted to JSON format

    - Prompt an LLM to help write a function ( buildGraph() ) that parses the OSM data using the JSON parser

    - Implement my version of Dijkstra's algorithm to provide the shorest path between two points on UIC campus.


Run the server with ```make run_server```

Open your browser to http://localhost:1251 to see the map once the server has loaded.
